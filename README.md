This is accompanying repository to post Optics beyond Lenses (TODO: add link when available)

## How to navigate the repo

Examples used in the article are in `com.example` package in `src/test` directory. The fact that snippets were 
transitioned to test cases made example code testable and (hopefully) readable thanks having expected result visible 
right away (instead of having to run some code).

Tests verifying lawfulness of some Optics are located in `com.example.laws`.
